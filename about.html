<p>
  Since 2017 I'm working as a full stack engineer in the field of automotive
  cloud services. I'm part of the full agile lifecycle from design, code, test
  and monitoring of these services.
</p>
<p>
  Before that (since 2012) I worked as an embedded developer writing bootloader
  software in <em>C / Assembler</em> for different electrical control units used
  in the automotive sector.
</p>
<p>I'm living in the area of Stuttgart in Germany.</p>
