pageTitle: pure HTML/CSS webpage that lasts long
---

I read a few times during the last days that creating a web page with **only HTML and CSS**, has the advantage of not being forced to update your frameworks again and again. It is a must for all my side projects that the effort for maintenance is as low as possible (otherwise they get outdated and die).

I started with [john-doe.neocities.org]("https://john-doe.neocities.org/) as a reference and changed a few things (mostly colors). I added my content and deployed the site by using github pages, which was really easy. See my git repo for all details [sschoebinger.github.io](https://github.com/sschoebinger/sschoebinger.github.io/tree/36995863bcb29a2ee526545c4217249136165d34)

It was okay to set all this up (with basic HTML and CSS knowledge) and it has some advantages for sure:

- 100% control of designed and structure
- fast (lighthouse 100% on first try)
- easy to deploy (e.g. github pages without CI/CD)
- you learn the basic again

But even with my few pages I already had the wish to **separate my content into different files** and if you start with multiple files you definitely need _templating_. In addition I always like to write content in _markdown_ which is no mandatory feature but nice to have.

**I'll definitely test some of the static site generators and see what is the cost for having templating and markdown support.**
