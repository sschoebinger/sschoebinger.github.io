    <h1>pure HTML/CSS webpage that lasts long</h1>

    <p>I read a few times during the last days that creating a web page with <strong>only HTML and CSS</strong>, has the advantage of not being forced to update your frameworks again and again. It is a must for all my side projects that the effort for maintenance is as low as possible (otherwise they get outdated and die).</p>
<p>I started with <a href="%22https://john-doe.neocities.org/">john-doe.neocities.org</a> as a reference and changed a few things (mostly colors). I added my content and deployed the site by using github pages, which was really easy. See my git repo for all details <a href="https://github.com/sschoebinger/sschoebinger.github.io/tree/36995863bcb29a2ee526545c4217249136165d34">sschoebinger.github.io</a></p>

<p>It was okay to set all this up (with basic HTML and CSS knowledge) and it has some advantages for sure:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% control of design and structure</li>
<li>fast (lighthouse 100% on first try)</li>
<li>easy to deploy (e.g. github pages without CI/CD)</li>
<li>you learn the basic again</li>
</ul>

<p>But even with my few pages I already had the wish to <strong>separate my content into different files</strong> and if you start with multiple files you definitely need <em>templating</em>. In addition I always like to write content in <em>markdown</em> which is no mandatory feature but nice to have.</p>
<p><strong>I'll definitely test some of the static site generators and see what is the cost of having templating and markdown support.</strong></p>
