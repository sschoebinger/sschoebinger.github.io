pageTitle: pure HTML/CSS webpage that lasts long
---

<p>
  I read a few times during the last days that creating a web page with
  <em>only HTML and CSS</em>, has the advantage of not being forced to update
  your frameworks again and again. It is a must for all my side projects that
  the effort for maintenance is as low as possible (otherwise they get outdated
  and die).

  I started with that
  <a href="https://john-doe.neocities.org/">john-doe.neocities.org</a>
  as a reference and changed a few things. See my git repo for all details

    Steren wrote about something Iâ€™ve been meaning to for years. My blog is the
    same, HTML, CSS, and a wee bit of JavaScript only when absolutely necessary.
