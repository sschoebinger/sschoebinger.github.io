    <h1>How to turn your smartphone into a webcam</h1>

    <p>For my daily work I use a macbook pro from 2017, I never liked the video of that webcam (and thats almost the same for all laptops). But as I doesn't use it a lot I never bought a separate webcam. When I was asked last week to give a remote presentation, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_lHk9Lf-ow">video</a> from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL-fHOdarou-CR2XUmK48Og">Scott Hanselman</a> came to my mind which is about turning your DSLR into a webcam. I first though I'll do the same but unfortunately my Sony DSC-HX50V doesn't have a clean HDMI video signal so it was not possible to follow that way.</p>
<p>However there was my old smartphone (HTC U11) which has a good camera but a broken display. Turning this smartphone into a webcam would be a cheap and good solution. As to my surprise it was pretty easy to do that.</p>
<p>All you need is</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://iriun.com/">Iriun</a> installed on your mac or windows laptop</li>
<li><a href="https://iriun.com/">Iriun</a> installed on your smartphone</li>
<li>Developer options enabled on your smartphone</li>
<li>Your smartphone connected via USB to your laptop</li>
</ol>
<p>If you open both the Iriun app on your smartphone and the Iriun program on your laptop you'll get a video preview from your phones camera on your laptop. And as it is connected via USB the latency is very good.</p>

<p>As I wanted to use this new video source for my presentation in Microsoft Teams I had to follow <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msteams/forum/msteams_tfb-msteams_tfmac/microsoft-teams-mac-os-client-is-not-recognizing/d9e863be-d9a4-4d03-a4b8-1b5c7df58828">these instructions</a>, as by default Microsoft Teams on Mac OS X is not allowed to use that video source. I hope Apple or Iriun can solve that issue soon!</p>
<p>This setup allowed me to reuse my broken smartphone as my webcam which has a much better camera as the laptop internal webcam. In addition I can chose much better perspectives than this standard &quot;face from below&quot; perspective. And last but not least I liked that by connecting the smartphone via USB the video latency is pretty good.</p>
